# VueGenie

VueGenie is a lightweight, agnostic Vue.js framework designed to provide out-of-the-box UI components, such as forms and data tables, with minimal configuration. It is built with flexibility in mind, so you can easily customize it to suit your needs, whether you're using Vuetify or any other UI library, or even without any UI library at all.

## Features

Agnostic Components: Designed to be flexible and compatible with any UI framework.
Out-of-the-box UI: Includes pre-built form and data-table components for quick integration.
Vue 3 Support: Built with Vue 3 for modern features and optimized performance.
Customizable: Easily extend and customize components to fit your projectâ€™s requirements.

## Installation

You can install VueGenie via npm or yarn.

### npm

```bash
npm install vue-genie
```

### yarn

```bash
yarn add vue-genie
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using VueGenie components in your project.

Import VueGenie components into your Vue component:

```vue
<script>
import { GenieForm, GenieTable } from "vue-genie";

export default {
  components: {
    GenieForm,
    GenieTable,
  },
};
</script>
```

Use the components in your template:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <GenieForm :formData="formData" />
    <GenieTable :tableData="tableData" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      formData: { name: "", email: "" },
      tableData: [
        { id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" },
        { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", email: "jane@example.com" },
      ],
    };
  },
};
</script>
```
